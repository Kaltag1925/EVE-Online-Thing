Code compiles and runs as desired. I don't like having to match capitalization on item names.

NPCs are there and they move around. In fact, there are almost too many of them at the beginning to keep track of
what is going on. That type of thing could happen in SlothMUD if you were in a really busy area as well. Mostly
because of human players though, not NPCs.

Code compiles and there is combat. There seem to be some issues though. One is that I can drop my equipped item
and it is still equipped for combat. Another is that NPCs don't seem to attack back. I can also flee when I'm not
in combat.
